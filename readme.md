Unleashing complexities of Event Handling !

## DESCRIPTION:

At TECHOMIA, we believe there is a better way to do event handling, a more valuable, less invasive way where organizations and universities are earned rather than bought. We are obsessively passionate about it. The Novelty associated with TECHOMIA is that our website is inexhautible. It cannot be used for organising just single event/fest instead can be used to organise multiple events/fest round the year by client organization.
